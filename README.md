# HomeWork-F.I.A.
Homework of Machine Learing part for "Fondamenti di Intelligenza Artificiale" course of computer science degree at Sapienza.
It's a risolution of several machine learning task without using scikit-learn libraries, but but reimplemented each models and solutions by hand.
On the provided dataset ('Online News Popularity Data Set') the tasks to solve are:
- Decision Trees classification
- Linear Regression (without regularization, with L1, L2, and elastic net regularization)
- Classification with Linear Regression (using the threshold function discussed in class)
- Classification with Logistic Regression
- Regression with k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm
- Classification with k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm
- Regression with Neural Networks
- Classification with Neural Networks
